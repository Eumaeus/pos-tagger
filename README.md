# pos-tagger

A Scala JS webapp to guide users to generate Part-of-Speech tags, as used by the Perseus Project's treebanking.

Runnable file at `downloads/index.html`.

I have made an effort to prevent Part-of-Speech tags that "identify" impossible forms (*e.g.* Imperfect Infintive). File issues if you notice something I have missed.

All code in the Public Domain.
